# MATHUSLA Mu-Simulation


_simulation of muons through earth material_

## Build & Run

The simulation comes with a simple build script called `install` which allows for build customization and execution of the muon simulation.

Here is a list of useful commands:

| Action             | Options for `./install` |
|:------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| Build Only         | `(none)`                |
| Build and Auto Run | `--run`                 |
| Clean CMake Build  | `--cmake --clean`       |
| More Options       | `--help`                |

After building, the executable, `simulation`, is moved into the root directory of the project.

The simulation executable itself comes with several configuration parameters:

| Action                | Short Options    | Long Options        |
|:---------------------:|:----------------:|:-------------------:|
| Event Count           | `-e <count>`     | `--events=<count>`  |
| Particle Generator    | `-g <generator>` | `--gen=<generator>` |
| Detector              | `-d <detector>`  | `--det=<detector>`  |
| Custom Script         | `-s <file>`      | `--script=<file>`   |
| Data Output Directory | `-o <dir>`       | `--out=<dir>`       |
| Number of Threads     | `-j <count>`     | `--threads=<count>` |
| Visualization         | `-v`             | `--vis`             |
| Save All Generator Events         | `NA` | `--save_all`        |
| Save Events With Pseudo-Digi Cuts (only for Cosmic geometry) | `NA` | `--cut_save`        |
| Bias Muon Nuclear interaction in Earth (for Cosmic and Box geometry) | `NA` | `--bias`        |
| Turn On Five Body Muon Decays     | `-f` | `--five_muon`       |
| Non-Random Five Body Decays       | `-n` | `--non_random`      |
| Quiet Mode            | `-q`             | `--quiet`           |
| Help                  | `-h`             | `--help`            |

Note: The Five Body Muon Decays option will only save tracks with a five-body decay in a certain zone in the detector. Be sure this is what you want.

Arguments can also be passed through the simulation to a script. Adding key value pairs which correspond to aliased arguments in a script, will be forwarded through. Here's an example:

```
./simulation -s example1.mac ke 100 phi 20
```

This will pass the key value pairs `(ke, 100)` and `(phi, 20)` to the underlying script `example1.mac`. The file can look something like this:

```
# example1.mac

/gen/select basic

/gen/basic/ke {ke} GeV
/gen/basic/phi {phi} deg
```

where `{ }` denotes a key. The script will be evaluated by substituting the key for its value so the last two lines become,

```
/gen/basic/ke 100 GeV
/gen/basic/phi 20 deg
```

All of the simulation configuration parameters can be passed through `./install --run` so the example above could also be written as,

```
./install --run -s example1.mac ke 100 phi 20
```

### Generators

There are three general purpose generators built in, `basic`, `range`, and `polar`. The `basic` generator produces a particle with constant `pT`, `eta`, and `phi` while the `range` generator produces particle within a specified range of values for each of the three variables. Any variable can also be fixed to a constant value. The `polar` generator uses the angles spherical coordinates, polar and azimuth, along with an energy  input to generate particles. The polar angle in `polar` generator can be either a constant or within a specified range, while the azimuth is only specified within a range.

There is also a _Pythia8_ generator installed which behaves similiarly to the `range` generator.

The generator defaults are specified in `src/action/GeneratorAction.cc` but they can be overwritten by a custom generation script.

### Custom Detector

A custom Detector can be specified at run time from one of the following installed detectors:

| Detector   | Status    | Details                                               |
|:----------:|:---------:|:-----------------------------------------------------:|
| Prototype  | COMPLETED | Test stand for the MATHUSLA project                   |
| Box        | COMPLETED | Large Detector as seen in MATHUSLA Original Schematic |
| Cosmic     | COMPLETED | Identical detector design as in Box but optimized for cosmic studies |
| Flat       | BUILDING  | Cheaper Alternative to Box                            |
| MuonMapper | COMPLETED | Measures Muon Energies after Rock Propagation         |

### Custom Scripts

A custom _Geant4_ script can be specified at run time. The script can contain generator specific commands and settings as well as _Pythia8_ settings in the form of `readString`. The script can also specify the detector to use during the simulation.
